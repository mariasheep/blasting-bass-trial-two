            <h3>A Crucial Step to remember when picking up your bass...</h3>
            <p><b>Correctly Tuning the Bass is essential to your playing.</b> When learning to play the bass, you always want to ensure 
                the bass is giving out the correct sound so as not to confuse you! It is an excellent habit to develop as it will
                always be important for playing bass, no matter what level you have reached! Below are some options to consider to
                ensure your bass is in tune.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Using a Physical Tuner.</b>Reliable, a good option if you will need to tune your bass in a 
                location with high levels of background noise!</li>
                <li><b>Use a Tuning App</b>These are widely available and may be available for free, such as Guitar Tuna.</li>
                <li><b>Tuning by Ear</b> is a skill usually developed with lots of experience. Practice will make perfect!</li>

                <h2> Starting out on Bass Guitar, What you Should Do! &#127928;</h2>
                <h3>We realise that picking up the bass for the first time can be a daunting experience for many. This page has been created
                    specifically to support you!</h3>

                <p>Some things I found beneficial when starting out learning bass guitar include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>&#127926; Choosing the Bass Guitar which suits you best</li>
                        <li>&#127926; Having Access to the Necessary Equipment, such as a strap if you will be playing standing up, and the most suitable amp.</li> 
                        <li>&#127926; Deciding whether you prefer the feel of playing with fingers or with a plectrum. Some songs sound better with either method nonetheless
                            it is still mostly up to personal preference.</li>
                        <li>&#127926; knowing the key of the song. Learning your scales and listening for the root note that crops up in the song and its chords can help you narrow down the key of a song. This can help you to craft a bassline that compliments the song.</li>
                        <li>&#127926; Familiarising yourself with the beat of a song at an early stage will prove beneficial. Keep in mind the tempo or signature of a song in mind in order to achieve steady playing..</li>
                        <li>&#127926; Be patient with yourself. No one picked up an instrument and learned it in one day. As you progress, you'll be able to link these smaller skills together and work your way up to playing entire songs or basslines.</li>
